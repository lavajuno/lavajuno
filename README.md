### Hi, I'm Juno.

I am currently studying computer science at Clarkson University. I also work part-time as an engineer and IT technician.

When I'm not busy with school or work, I enjoy writing my own software and contributing to other projects.
I help maintain the [Clarkson Open Source Institute](https://github.com/COSI-Lab/)'s infrastructure and software, and have a few projects of my own related to networks and amateur radio.
